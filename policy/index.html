    <h1>DocuDash: Instant Document Viewer - Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective Date: March 22, 2025</strong></p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Thank you for using DocuDash: Instant Document Viewer ("DocuDash", "we", "our", or "the extension"). This Privacy Policy is designed to help you understand how your information is collected, used, and disclosed when you use our Chrome extension.</p>

    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>

    <h3>Information You Provide Directly</h3>
    <p>When you upload documents through DocuDash, the following occurs:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Document Uploads</strong>: When you choose to upload Office documents (DOCX, DOC, XLSX, XLS, PPTX, PPT, RTF) or OpenDocument formats (ODT, ODS, ODP) that require an external viewer service, these files are temporarily uploaded to tmpfiles.org.</li>
        <li><strong>Local File Handling</strong>: For supported file types (PDF, TXT, PNG, JPG, JPEG, GIF, BMP, CSV, MP3, MP4, WAV), we process these files locally in your browser without uploading them to any external servers.</li>
        <li><strong>HTML Content</strong>: HTML/HTM files are converted to data URLs and opened locally in your browser without external transmission.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Information We Do Not Collect</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>We do not collect or store your documents on our servers.</li>
        <li>We do not track your browsing history.</li>
        <li>We do not collect personal identification information.</li>
        <li>We do not use cookies or similar tracking technologies.</li>
        <li>The extension operates in a way that makes it technically impossible for us to monitor your document viewing activity.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How We Use Information</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Document Viewing</strong>: We use document links and uploaded files solely to facilitate document viewing in your browser.</li>
        <li><strong>Third-Party Services</strong>: When necessary for certain file types, we utilize third-party services:
            <ul>
                <li>Microsoft Office Online Viewer for Office documents and OpenDocument formats</li>
                <li>tmpfiles.org for temporary file hosting when required</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data Sharing and Disclosure</h2>

    <h3>Third-Party Services</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>tmpfiles.org</strong>: Documents uploaded through our extension are temporarily stored on tmpfiles.org and are automatically deleted after 60 minutes. While these documents are unlikely to be discovered by others during this period, we cannot guarantee absolute privacy for uploaded content.</li>
        <li><strong>Microsoft Office Online Viewer</strong>: When viewing Office documents and OpenDocument formats, the document URL is passed to Microsoft's online viewing service.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Legal Requirements</h3>
    <p>We may disclose information if required to do so by law or if we believe in good faith that such action is necessary to comply with applicable laws or respond to a court order, judicial or other government subpoena, or warrant.</p>

    <h2>Data Security</h2>
    <p>We implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect the information that is processed through our extension. However, please be aware that no method of transmission over the internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure.</p>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>Our extension is not directed to children under the age of 13, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on the Chrome Web Store and updating the "Effective Date" at the top of this policy.</p>

    <h2>Your Choices</h2>
    <p>You can control what information is shared by:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Choosing not to upload sensitive documents through the extension</li>
        <li>Being selective about which document links you open with DocuDash</li>
    </ul>
